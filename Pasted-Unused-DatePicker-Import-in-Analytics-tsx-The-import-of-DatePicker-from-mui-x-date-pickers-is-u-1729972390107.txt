Unused DatePicker Import in Analytics.tsx:

The import of DatePicker from @mui/x-date-pickers is unused in the latest version of the Analytics.tsx file.
Solution: Remove the import to eliminate the unused import warning.
import { DatePicker } from '@mui/x-date-pickers'; // Remove this line

DashboardCard Import Issue in Dashboard/index.tsx (Default Import):

You mentioned that there is an import issue for DashboardCard. This is likely caused by importing it incorrectly.
Solution: Make sure you use a default import for DashboardCard.
import DashboardCard from '../components/DashboardCard'; // Correct way to import it as a default export

Ensure that the DashboardCard file has a default export, which it does in your provided code:
export default DashboardCard;
Missing RewardsManager Module:

It seems like the RewardsManager component might not be correctly exported or imported. Ensure the component is exported properly in its respective file.
Solution: In the file where RewardsManager is defined (RewardsManager.tsx), ensure you have:
export default RewardsManager;

Then, when importing it:
import RewardsManager from '../components/RewardsManager'; // Adjust the path if necessary

Export Type Issues for DashboardCardProps and AnalyticsData:

For DashboardCardProps and AnalyticsData, make sure that the types are exported from the types.ts file so they can be used elsewhere.
Solution: In types.ts, ensure these types are exported correctly:

// In types.ts
export interface DashboardCardProps {
title: string;
value: number | string;
icon: 'users' | 'gift' | 'chart' | 'token';
trend: string;
}

export interface AnalyticsData {
userMetrics: {
total_users: number;
active_users: number;
new_users: number;
avg_user_lifetime_days: number;
};
rewardsAnalytics: Array<{
category: string;
total_rewards: number;
active_rewards: number;
avg_points_cost: number;
}>;
pointsAnalytics: Array<{
date: string;
transaction_type: string;
transaction_count: number;
total_points: number;
avg_points_per_transaction: number;
}>;
nftAnalytics: Array<{
date: string;
total_minted: number;
unique_minters: number;
avg_mints_per_user: number;
}>;
}

When importing these types in other files (DashboardCard.tsx, Analytics.tsx, etc.):
import type { DashboardCardProps, AnalyticsData } from '../types';
